# Intrusion Detection System for DOS attacks

( Pls refer the BTP mid term presentation and Transforms_accuracy document for detailed study of the project)


# Overview 

This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses Wavelet Transform for effective detection of network attacks. By Using the wavelet transform's ability to analyze both time and frequency, the IDS can identify subtle and abrupt changes in network traffic patterns. 

Trained with datasets like NSL-KDD and WSN-DS, it can detect a wide range of cyber threats, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, probing, and unauthorized access attempts. The system uses machine learning to quickly and efficiently spot threats, even in resource-constrained environments like IoT devices and wireless networks, ensuring robust protection against both known and new attacks!

# Results got so far 

Till now we have a got around 98% accuracy with classifiers like ada boost , cat boost , boosting 

Below are some of the results that we got initially with simple classifiers like Random Forest and Decision Tree
